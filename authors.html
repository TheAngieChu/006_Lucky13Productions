                    <p><b>Angela Nicole Chu</b> is a thirtysomething bestselling author from Louisville, KY. She writes character-driven New Adult Romantasy novels featuring badass female heroines, cinnamon-roll heroes, and a slew of vampires that delight and bite. Most of her tales include suspense and sleuthing. She blames her mother for raising her on Dateline Mysteries.
                        
                      Chu completed her first novel in the seventh grade. It was a horrendous mess and a crime against humanity, but it was fabulous practice. Especially when she continued on with three more of them. Since then, she's lived her life with a mix of kindness, pettiness, and general mischief, and it shows in her books.
                        
                      Chu currently resides in Louisville, KY with her husband, their son and daughter, their four cats, and their two Aussie pups. Click <a href="https://theangiechu.net/book-series-by-angela-nicole-chu">HERE</a> to read her books!</p>
